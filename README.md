# frontend-basics-course

Hi everyone.

Here is the repository that you have to clone, and then use to upload all of your homeworks.

## Folder structure
`firstName.lastName/numberOfLecture/homeworkFiles`

Yes, you will be able to take a look at the homeworks of other guys. It's fine, we're all adults and you guys payed for this
course so I hope that you will learn one thing or two by yourself and become a developers someday in the future.

## Workflow

- You get your homework from the Google Class, 
- You implement it in the branch with name like `firstName.lastName/numberOfLecture`.
- You open a pull request (PR) to the master and assign me to review. 
- I review that and give you some comments. 
- You fix those comments related issues
- I take a look once again and approve it
- You merge it whenever you like to the master

## Issues
